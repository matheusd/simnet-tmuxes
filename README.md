# Simnet Tmuxes

This repo contains a bunch of tmux automation scripts that ease setup/execution/teardown of simnet's for decred (and eventually other cryptocurrencies).

Most of the scripts can be run as `./script.tmux` with little or no previous setup.

In general, you'll need to have the decred tools (`dcrd`, `dcrctl`, `dcrwallet`, etc) installed in your `$GOPATH/bin` dir (or otherwise accesible on your `$PATH`).
